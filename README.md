These technologies were used:

- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

## ðŸ“– Documentation 

### Utility Library

If you look into the ```./utilityLibrary``` folder, you'll find a class called **SpotifyAPI** which wraps, through it's methods, a lot of the different Spotifi Web API endpoints. You simply pass it in your authentication token after logging in (which you can see in the **LoginContainer** file in the ```./container``` folder) and then call any of the methods that you want, .getAlbum, .getAlbumTracks, .getFeaturedPlaylists.

There is about 1,000 lines of code in there, the majority of the API endpoints are wrapped but there's still a few I need to add, but it should still make the process of interacting with the API a lot easier.

I'll release the file itself soon enough as an NPM package in itself since I've noticed that the spotify-api NPM package that's currently being the most used isn't really up to date. 

### Folder Structure

This boilerplate has been set up with React, Styled-Components, Redux, and React-Router

#### React

The React components are subdivided between two folders, ``` ./components```and ```./containers```. Generally, containers refer to "smart" components and components refers to "dumb" components. Dumb here meaning stateless or re-usable. I generally use the containers folder to have my main pages './HomePageContainer', './AboutPageContainer', etc. and keep all the re-usable components that compose these containers in the components folder. When the project grows, the folder structure is usually re-organized for all the related components to be grouped together in new folders.

#### Styled-Components

You'll find all of the re-usable components created through Styled-Components in the ```./styledComponents``` folder. If you don't like that name, you can rename it to ```./UILibrary```, ```./coreUILibrary```, whatever makes sense to you.

#### React-Router

The routes are all stored in the ```Routes.js``` file of the ```./routing``` folder. There, you'll find two special components

1. ```UnauthenticatedRoute``` --> Routes that don't require the user to be logged in to be displayed
2. ```AuthenticatedRoute``` --> Routes that require the user to be logged in to be displayed

The **Authentication state** is stored in the **authentication reducer** in the Redux store. It is passed down as a prop to the ```App.js``` component. Any call to the reducer with the respective action creator will trigger the **isAuthenticated** state to change and will show or hide displays accordingly.

#### Action Creators

Actions creator functions are all stored in the ```./actionCreators``` file

#### Reducers

Finally, the reducers are all in the ```./reducers``` file, which for now contains two reducers. The authentication reducer, which we've discussed before, and the spotify reducer, which processes spotify-api related actions. For now, the only action available there is **STORE_USER_DATA**, which, as expected, stores the users data upon logging in.


## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Clone the GitHub repository 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abdelshok/react-redux-spotify-boilerplate.git yourApplicationName
   ```

2. Register your Spotify Application using [these instructions](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app) and whitelist the URI that you'll be using by going into settings. In this case, localhost:3000 so you should whitelist this in the settings:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Note the Client ID, the Client Secret, and the Redirect URI (above) and add them to the variables with the corresponding names in ./server.js. Remember to move them into .env before committing these secret keys to your repo.

4. Run    ``` npm install ```

4. Redesign & start coding. 


## Why â›©

I created this boilerplate because the documentation to set up authorization and start a project using the Spotify API was pretty confusing to me and after looking around for other React-Redux boilerplates, I thought that the few there were weren't well commented, designed, and that the file structures set up were also a little off putting. I decided to create my own in the hopes of making it easier for someone else who wants to create a Spotify-based project to get started. I did find a "boilerplate" that had React, Redux, and Styled-Components set up, but it is honestly a full application that looked exactly like the Spotify Web App. It's great and very well done, but it isn't very useful if someone wants to create their own application, since they would have to delete or comment out a lot of the code. This boilerplate is meant to be a starting point, not a full stop, which is why I provide the strict minimum in terms of design but all the necessary spotify-related functions you might need. I used a class called SpotifyAPI, which you'll find in /utilityLibrary/spotify.js) to wrap most of the API endpoints of the Spotify Web API you might so want to use throughout in web application.

Now, it is also important to note that this boilerplate is for one type of project, one that has only a front-end interacting with the Spotify API and no "server". Accordingly, if you've read some of the Spotify documentation, this means that it utilizes the Implicit Grant Authorization flow, which I'll expand upon below

The Spotify API has [three types of authorization flows](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) you can use depending on what kind of project you want to create.

- The **Client Credentials Flow** is used typically between a server and the Spotify API directly. It is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. Typically, it can be used by clients to access resources about themselves.
- The **Authorization Code Flow** is used if you want to create a long-running application (that requires user permissions only once) with a back-end service, which can be Node.js or otherwise. I can see this being useful if someone wants to create a mobile application using the Spotify API. Users only need to authenticate once and can keep using the application unbothered as the permission tokens get continuously refreshed (read more about it in the above documentation).

In this case, I implemented the **Implicit Grant Flow**, which has two characteristics:

1. Tokens expire much more quickly (3600 seconds --> every hour) than in the Authorization Code Flow (which might be perceived as a negative user experience as the users need to login again)
2. You can skip some of the extra function calls that are necessary to be made in the Authorization Code Flow, directly retrieve your access token, and use it to make calls to the Spotify Web API directly from your React front-end components (which I perceive as a positive feature)

This is a work in progress, more information will come later.
